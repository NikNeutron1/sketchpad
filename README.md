# Sketchpad

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 16.2.16.

The Project is extracted from a bigger personal project I got going on.

It is meant to showcase my approach to coding with angular as well as some of the problems I care about.

Unit Tests only exist in limited form and only for the purpose of showcasing my ability to write them. The personal project doesn't contain many of them due to it not having any production pressure or collaboration with other developers.

Example Unit Test Classes
    point-2d.spec.ts tests some functions of a utility class

(TODO) add test classes for at least one service and one component to demonstrate mocking.    

## RUN LOCALLY (DEV MODE)

Run `ng serve` or  `npm test` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

# RUN TESTS

Run `npm run test`.

# BUILDING AND DEPLOYMENT

There is no deployment pipeline set up yet.
