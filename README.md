# Sketchpad

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 16.2.16.

The Project is extracted from a bigger personal project I got going on.

It is meant to showcase my approach to coding with angular as well as some of the problems I care about.

## Run Locally in Dev Mode

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.
